This is a project on 3D_SSDsim, based on ssdsim under the framework of the completion of structures, the main function:
1.Support for 3D commands, for example:mutli plane\interleave\copyback\program suspend/Resume..etc
2.Multi - level parallel simulation
3.Clear hierarchical interface
4.4-layer structure

FileName£º ftl.h
Author: Zuo Lu 		Version: 1.9	Date:2017/10/11
Description:
ftl layer: can not interrupt the global gc operation, gc operation to migrate valid pages using ordinary read and write operations, remove support copyback operation;
